# Learning_Datastructures
> ## Queue
**Ques is an linear data structure where you can add element from one side and delete from another side as well.**
We have first in first out and last in last out.

Here adding element at the rear and removing front 

Add Element --> Enqueue --> append method 
Delete Element --> Dequeue --> pop method

`Two ways of implementation`
### 1. List 
In the list we can normally define and use the pop and append function 

### 2. Module
In this need to import the `queue or collection` package to make the queue.

> ## Linked List:
** It basisclly contains chain of nodes those nodes contains data field, link, reference. **
